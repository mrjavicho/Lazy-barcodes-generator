# Lazy Barcodes Generator 

:zzz: :bar_chart:

Hey there! :wave: Welcome to the repository of the laziest barcode generator on the internet. You see, I'm so lazy that even writing a detailed README seems like an Olympic effort. :sweat_smile:

But, since you're here, let me tell you something: this barcode generator is so simple and straightforward that writing an insightful README would be like painting a mustache on the Mona Lisa. It just doesn't make sense!

So, without further ado, here's the link to the Lazy Barcodes Generator that you're probably looking for: https://mrjavicho.github.io/Lazy-barcodes-generator/

Go ahead, give it a try! And remember, being lazy is an art form. :wink: :art:

Have fun generating barcodes the lazy way! :smirk: :bar_chart:
